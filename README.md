# AgileCamp Bootstrap

TODO: Briefly describe this repo and Project Dendro


## Instructions

1. Download and extract the Bootstrap source files to a separate directory, such as `bootstrap-4.0.0`. This should be outside of this repo’s project directory.

2. Complete the Bootstrap [Tooling setup](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/build-tools/#tooling-setup) instructions.

3. Make this project directory the current directory, i.e. `cd agilecamp-bootstrap`.

4. Feel free to modify variables in `scss/_custom.scss` to customize the build. Be sure to commit any changes.

5. To perform the build, specify the location of the external Bootstrap source files and run the build script as shown:

	```bash
	$ BOOTSTRAP=../bootstrap-4.0.0 npm run build
	```

6. If all goes well, the compiled Bootstrap files will be copied to this project’s `dist` directory.
